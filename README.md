# ðŸ’» Laptop Price Predictor

This project predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications using Machine Learning.  
It uses an end-to-end ML pipeline with **feature engineering, ensemble learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, ExtraTrees)** and is deployed with **Streamlit** for an interactive UI.
